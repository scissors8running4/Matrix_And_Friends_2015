# Matrix_And_Friends_2015

I made these classes while learning the basics of C++ in CS1 and CS2. They include a simple matrix class and corresponding utilities and algebra classes. They also include a couple of thread pool classes and Strassen multiplication functors. I made test files to show class effectiveness and a nifty timer class for speed trials.
  I had fun working on these items, yet am sure that much room for improvement exists in them. I would love to get constructive criticism which could be used to improve speed or flexibility in any of these classes.
  In the future I plan to work on greater flexibility for matrix operations on matrices of different types (such as complex<double> with double) and to add LU factorization capabilities to the algebra class. I wish to design a nice task scheduler in the spirit of Intel TBB as well. That will take some serious effort on my part however.
  
  Peace out for now, Matt.
